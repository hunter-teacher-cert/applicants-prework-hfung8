Exercise 2)

The banana method is setting up an variable called kiwi which is an integer, and multiplying it by each value inside of 
the a array, for the length of the a array. kiwi is the value returned at the end of the method. 

public static int banana(int[] a) {
    int kiwi = 1;
    int i = 0;
    while (i < a.length) {
        kiwi = kiwi * a[i];
        i++;
    }
    return kiwi;
}

The grapefruit method is searching for the index of the grape element in the a array and returning the index.
If there is no grape element in the a array, then the method returns -1. i is the index of the element grape in the 
array a. 

public static int grapefruit(int[] a, int grape) {
    for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
        if (a[i] == grape) {
            return i;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}

The pineapple method is counting the amount of times the apple element is in the array a and returning that value. 
pear is used as a counter for the pineapple method. 

public static int pineapple(int[] a, int apple) {
    int pear = 0;
    for (int pine: a) {
        if (pine == apple) {
            pear++;
        }
    }
    return pear;
}
